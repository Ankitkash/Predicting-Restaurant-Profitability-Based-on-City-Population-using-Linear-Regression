# Predicting Restaurant Profitability Based on City Population using Linear Regression

## Project Overview
This project implements linear regression with one variable to predict profits for a restaurant franchise based on city population.


## Problem Statement
As the CEO of a restaurant franchise, the goal is to identify cities that are likely to generate higher profits based on population data. The dataset consists of city populations and corresponding restaurant profits.

## Project Workflow

### Step 1: Load the Dataset
- The `load_data()` function loads the city population (`x_train`) and restaurant profits (`y_train`).

### Step 2: Data Visualization
- Visualize the data to understand the relationship between population and profit using Matplotlib.

### Step 3: Compute Cost Function
- Implement the cost function to measure the performance of the linear regression model.

### Step 4: Gradient Descent
- Apply batch gradient descent to optimize the parameters and minimize the cost function.

### Step 5: Model Training
- Train the linear regression model and plot the regression line.

### Step 6: Prediction
- Predict the profitability of new cities based on population data.

## Results
- The linear regression model effectively captures the relationship between city population and restaurant profitability.
- The visual representation of the regression line shows accurate predictions.
